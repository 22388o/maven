        <span>Illness</span>
        <p>
          Hydrocephaly.<br />
          Since he was born he was diagnosed with Hydrocephalus, which needed to
          be treated with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt valve (which goes from
          his brain to his abdomen), and needs to be controlled frequently. His
          brain disease has affected his motor skills, he can’t walk by himself,
          and has cognitive impairment. He also has non controlled asthma.
