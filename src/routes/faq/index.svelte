              The letters NFT stand for Non-Fungible Token. Ok, so what does
              fungible mean?! Good question, it’s not a commonly used word. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Fungible means something that is not particularly unique and can
              be replaced by something just like it. For example, if you have a
              dollar bill in your wallet and your friend has one, you can
              exchange your dollar bills with each other and you have the same
              value and really your life hasn’t changed much! So money is
              fungible, gold is fungible, heck your coffee table is fungible and
              can be replaced with an identical one if needed. But you are
              Non-fungible! You are unique. So is the Mona Lisa painting or that
              old car your friend is restoring. There is no one just like you or
              a painting just like the Mona Lisa! Unique things are
              non-fungible. 
            </p>

            <p>
              A token is basically a voucher that serves as a representation of
              an item. A movie ticket is a token for example. It represents your
              right to enter the theatre and see the movie. 
            </p>

            <p>
              So a Non-Fungible Token is a unique representation of ownership.
              Recently, NFTs have become very popular as digital contracts or
              “smart contracts”. They are stored online in digital form and are
              made unchangeable, secure and private by using blockchain
              technology.

              A blockchain is just a collection of transactions, or items, like
              the lines of groceries in your grocery list. Each grocery item is
              like the transactions in a block and the whole grocery list is a
              block of information. On a blockchain, blocks of information are
              tied together and connected into a chain of blocks. So your
              grocery list tied to your neighbors grocery list, and to another
              one and so on creates a chain of blocks of information… aka a
              blockchain!
            </p>

            <p>
              The power of blockchain technology is that it isn’t just stored on
              one computer. It’s stored on hundreds or thousands around the
              world. So it makes it very difficult to hack (change the
              information) because if one copy on one computer changes it is
              compared to the others and they quickly figure out something is
              wrong. And it is disallowed. No particular person, company or
              government is in charge of the group of computers maintaining the
              blockchain. So the information is very secure. 
            </p>

            <p>
              So…an NFT is really a unique digital contract stored all over the
              world at once in a very secure way. And this is powerful and it is
              changing the world and the way business is done!
            </p>

            <p>
              Your NFTs can be traded on the Maven NFT marketplace, an online
              NFT marketplace that specializes in NFTs that represent real world
              assets or tangible things. With your NFT able to be sold on the
              marketplace, it means your NFT has liquidity. You can put it up
              for sale, you can trade it for other NFTs or you can hold it and
              reap the harvest production earnings over time. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Now that you understand what an NFT is and what it can do, we hope
              you choose to join our Vida Verde family and become an owner of
              one or more of our unique NFTs.
